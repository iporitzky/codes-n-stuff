I worked on an analysis using https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset that looked at the claim of whether more older people die of COVID-19. Unsurprisingly, the analysis found that the average age of someone who died of COVID is 20 years older than someone who lived. I also found that men have higher death rates than women.
